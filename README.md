# Simplicity Via Clarity

As a user I would like to know who is visiting my website and see what pages they are on as well as user activity.

## Description
* What problem does your app focus on
-Records website traffic for clients websites. 

* How does your app solve this problem at a high-level
-Gives insight to what potentials buyers are viewing.

* What steps did you take to build the app
1) Created firebase login authentication
2) Created site integration for other sites
3) Once we've had the users data we could create graphs and charts

* Show the app running solving the problem that began your story. Also talk about what features you'd like to add in an update to your app.  


## Instructions
1. Add the following code just before the closing `</head>` tag on your site,
```
