# Simplicity Via Clarity

As a user I would like to know who is visiting my website and see what pages they are on as well as user activity.

## Instructions
1. Add the following code just before the closing `</head>` tag on your site,
```
<!-- Simplicity Via Clarity Listener JS -->
<script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/7.0.0/firebase-app.js"></script>
<script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/7.0.0/firebase-database.js"></script>
<script src="https://simplicityviaclarity.com/svc/svc-client.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```
2. Log into the [Admin Portal](https://simplicityviaclarity.com/) to view real-time updates.
